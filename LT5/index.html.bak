							<h3> Smoke and Mirrors </h3>
							<p> <b> <i> Pathways </i> </b> </p>
							<p> There were so many paths I could have taken in my life. Like the one that ran by the riverbank, where wild roses grew with sharp thorns. Or perhaps I should have followed my instincs and explored the track that wound its way through a dark and mysterious forest. </p>
							<p> However, I ended up choosing the path of least resistance. The one that looked the easiest. Only to discover it was made of quicksand. </p>

							<h3> Love Looks Pretty On You </h3>
							<p> <b> <i> I Know Love </i> </b> </p>
							<p> I know love now because I am in love. Because of how long I've loved. Because of the man I love. </p>
							<p> Love used to be a beautiful mirage, a moonbeam on the water I tried to cup in my hands. Now it is a grand oak tree, tried and tested, roots driving deep down into the earth. I have a love that takes me across oceans. A love that tells me I am home, no matter where I am in the world. </p>

							<h3> Dirty Pretty Things </h3>

							<p> The most beautiful sound in the world to me is not the forest birdsong or babbling brooks or even the ringing of church bells. It's hearing you whisper, 'I love you', over and over again. </p>
